## **Telecom Customer Churn Prediction**

**Project Overview**

This project aims to develop and evaluate classification models to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to identify factors influencing customer churn and build predictive models to assist telecom service providers in retaining their customers.

**Problem Statement**

Telecom service providers face the challenge of customer attrition, which can significantly impact their revenue and growth. The cost of acquiring new customers is typically higher than retaining existing ones. By accurately predicting customer churn, telecom companies can implement targeted retention strategies to reduce customer loss.

**Methodology**

1.  **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
    
    -   Gather relevant customer data, including demographic information, service usage patterns, payment history, and churn status.
    -   Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
    -   Feature engineering to create informative features from existing data.
2.  **Model Development:**
    
    -   Implement and train various classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest Classifier.
    -   Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3.  **Model Selection and Refinement:**
    
    -   Compare the performance of different models to select the best-performing one.
    -   Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

**Expected Outcomes**

-   Accurate prediction of customer churn, enabling proactive retention efforts.
-   Identification of key factors influencing customer churn for targeted interventions.
-   Improved customer satisfaction and loyalty through personalized offers and services.
-   Increased revenue and reduced customer acquisition costs.

**Future Work**

-   Explore advanced machine learning techniques such as deep learning for enhanced prediction accuracy.
-   Incorporate real-time data streams for dynamic churn prediction.
-   Develop a comprehensive customer lifetime value (CLTV) model to assess the potential value of each customer.
